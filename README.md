# Sales and Revenue Forecasting for a Multi-State Retailer: Machine Learning and Time-Series Analysis
This project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning and time-series forecasting techniques to address two key objectives for a prominent retailer: predicting item-specific sales revenue and forecasting total revenue across multiple stores. The XGBoost model emerged as the most effective predictive model, achieving superior accuracy with low RMSE and MAE scores. For time-series forecasting, the SARIMAX model was optimized to identify seasonal and temporal patterns, delivering reliable revenue predictions for the next seven days.

This project has demonstrated significant business impact, including improved decision-making, optimized inventory management, and enhanced operational efficiency. Future work could explore advanced ensemble techniques, further hyperparameter tuning, and alternative time-series models such as Prophet or deep learning approaches to achieve even greater accuracy and adaptability. These enhancements would ensure continuous improvement and alignment with evolving business needs, cementing the retailer's competitive edge in a dynamic market.
