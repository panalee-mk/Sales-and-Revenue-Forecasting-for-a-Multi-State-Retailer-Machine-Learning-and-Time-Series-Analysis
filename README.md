# Retail Sales and Revenue Forecasting Project
## Project Overview
In today’s fast-paced retail world, data-driven decisions can make or break a business. Imagine being able to predict how much of a product will sell in a specific store on a given day or forecasting the total revenue for the next week. That’s exactly what this project set out to achieve for a retailer operating across California, Texas, and Wisconsin. The retailer needed a reliable way to tackle two major goals:

1. Predict item-specific sales revenue for a given store and date using machine learning models.
2. Forecast total revenue across all stores and items for the next 7 days using a time-series model.

By building predictive and forecasting models, this project aims to optimize inventory management, improve financial planning, and enhance decision-making processes.

### Key Features
- Predictive Model: Uses machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, XGBoost) to forecast item-specific sales revenue.
- Time-Series Forecasting: Employs the SARIMAX model to predict total revenue for the next 7 days.

### Real Business Impact
What does this all mean for the retailer? Better decision-making, optimized stock levels, and efficient resource allocation. For example, by knowing which products will sell best and when, the retailer can avoid overstocking or stockouts, saving money and boosting profits. Plus, the insights empower targeted marketing and smarter financial planning.
